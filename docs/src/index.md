# Vela.jl

A Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package.

The `Vela.jl` project aims to develop a fast and simple-to-use framework for doing Bayesian
pulsar timing & noise analysis. It currently supports both narrowband and wideband TOAs along 
with most commonly used pulsar timing models. It can be used from Julia REPL, scripts, or 
notebooks. It can also be used from Python REPL, scripts, and notebooks with the help of the 
`pint2vela` interface.

`Vela.jl` is named after the brightest radio pulsar, the Vela pulsar (J0835-4510).
Also, Vēḻa (വേള, वेळ, ...) is a word meaning occasion, time, etc. in some Indian
languages.

It is under active development.
