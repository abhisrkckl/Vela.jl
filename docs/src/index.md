# Vela.jl

A Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package.

The `Vela.jl` project aims to develop a fast and simple-to-use framework for doing Bayesian
pulsar timing & noise analysis. It currently supports both narrowband and wideband TOAs along 
with most commonly used pulsar timing models. It can be used from Julia REPL, scripts, or 
notebooks. It can also be used from Python REPL, scripts, and notebooks with the help of the 
`pint2vela` interface.

`Vela.jl` is named after the brightest radio pulsar, the [Vela pulsar (J0835-4510)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Pulsar).
Also, Vēḻa (വേള) is a word meaning occasion, time, etc. in the [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam) language with cognates in 
many other Indian languages.

It is under active development.
